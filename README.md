# quasi-star-model
This is a MESA model simulating a quasi-star -- a massive, star-like object containing a black hole in its core that acts as a heavy SMBH seeding mechanism. 
This is an early version, created to replicate the work of [Ball 2012](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012PhDT.........1B/abstract). 
Additional features, processes, data, and plots will be added as development and research continues.
